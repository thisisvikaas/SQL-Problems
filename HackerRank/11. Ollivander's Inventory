11. Ollivander's Inventory

--Problem Statment
Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power. If more than one wand has same power, sort the result in order of descending age.

--Sample Input

Wands: The id is the id of the wand, code is the code of the wand, coins_needed is the total number of gold galleons needed to buy the wand, and power denotes the quality of the wand (the higher the power, the better the wand is).

Wands_Property: The code is the code of the wand, age is the age of the wand, and is_evil denotes whether the wand is good for the dark arts. If the value of is_evil is 0, it means that the wand is not evil. The mapping between code and age is one-one, meaning that if there are two pairs, code 1 != code 2 and age1 != age2 


--Sample Output
9 45 1647 10
12 17 9897 10
1 20 3688 8
15 40 6018 7
19 20 7651 6
11 40 7587 5
10 20 504 5
18 40 3312 3
20 17 5689 3
5 45 6020 2
14 40 5408 1


--Solution
select id, age, coins_needed, power
from (select id, w.code, coins_needed, power, age, 
    rank() over (partition by w.code, power order by coins_needed) as coin_rank
from wands w inner join wands_property wp on w.code = wp.code
where is_evil = 0)s
where coin_rank = 1
order by power desc, age desc
