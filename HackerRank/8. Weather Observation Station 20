8. Weather Observation Station 20

--Problem Statment

A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.

--Sample Input
Station table has fields: id, city, state, lat_n, long_w

-- Solution 

with lat_order_table as(
select lat_n, 
       rank() over (order by lat_n) as lat_order, 
       (select count(1) from station) as count_lat
from station)

select round(avg(lat_n),4)
from lat_order_table
where lat_order between count_lat/2 and (count_lat/2)+1

#The where clause ensures that weâ€™ll get the two middle values if there is an even number of values, and the single middle number if there is an odd number of values because between is inclusive of its bounds.
