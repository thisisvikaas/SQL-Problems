6. Weather Observation Station 18


--Problem Statment
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.
- a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
- b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
- c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
- d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

--Sample Input
Station table has fields: id, city, state, lat_n, long_w

--Solution
# Manhattan Distance : The distance between two points measured along axes at right angles. In a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2, y2), it is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|

select round(
		abs(min(lat_n)-max(lat_n))
		 + 
		abs(min(long_w)-max(long_w))
		,4)
