2. Occupations

--Problem Statment
Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.

Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.


--Sample Input 
Name     | Occupation
--------------
Samantha | Doctor
Maria    | Actor
Meera    | Actor
Ashley   | Singer
Ketty    | Professor

--Sample Output
Samantha Ketty Ashley Meera
NULL	 NULL  NULL  Maria

The first column is an alphabetically ordered list of Doctor names.
The second column is an alphabetically ordered list of Professor names.
The third column is an alphabetically ordered list of Singer names.
The fourth column is an alphabetically ordered list of Actor names.
The empty cell data for columns with less than the maximum number of names per occupation (in this case, the Professor and Actor columns) are filled with NULL values.

--Solution 
select min(doc), min(prof), min(sing), min(act)
from
(
select 
    rank() over (partition by occupation order by name) as occu_rank,
    case when occupation = 'Doctor' then name end as doc,
    case when occupation = 'Professor' then name end as prof,
    case when occupation = 'Singer' then name end as sing,
    case when occupation = 'Actor' then name end as act
